# Zero-Shot Learning on AWA2 Dataset with an Unconventional 50:50 Seen-Unseen Split.
Code for IAB is borrowed from [IAB-GZSL](https://github.com/LanchJL/IAB-GZSL) repo which contains the code for [Estimation of Near-Instance-Level Attribute Bottleneck for Zero-Shot Learning (IJCV 2024)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11263-024-02021-x)

The project also explores Class Normalization from [class-norm](https://github.com/universome/class-norm) repo which implements [Class Normalization for Continual Zero-Shot Learning paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11328) from ICLR 2021.
